## Overview
This is just a simple carrier board for a Raspberry Pi Pico and an RTC as I begin working with the Pico. I have a couple old projects that use AVR MCUs to drive DotStar LEDs, so replacing those with Picos sounded fairly straightforward. I added a button, three LEDs, and another header with some GPIO pins, so I may also use the board for general experimentation. Once I figure out the Pico's RTC, a separate RTC may not be needed.
